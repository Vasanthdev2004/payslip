# Kred

**Verifiable proof-of-income for onchain freelancers — built on [Arc](https://www.arc.io/), Circle's stablecoin-native L1, powered by Arc Transaction Memos.**

Freelancers paid in USDC/EURC have no payslip — nothing a bank, landlord, or visa
officer will accept. Kred turns your Arc payment history into a **verifiable,
selectively-shareable proof of income**: a statement where every line is backed by an
on-chain tx hash, and a public verify link a third party can confirm against Arc
**without trusting your word**.

> The chain is always the source of truth for amounts. Our database stores only tags
> and disclosure preferences — never the numbers.

## Why Arc Transaction Memos

An Arc payment settles instantly but arrives as a bare transfer. Arc's **Memo contract**
lets a payer attach structured context (invoice, project, period) to a payment — and,
because it routes through the `CALL_FROM` precompile, the payment still emits a normal
ERC-20 `Transfer` from the **real payer** plus a `Memo` event in the **same transaction**.
Kred reads both (F1) and writes them (F3). See [`docs/arc-notes.md`](docs/arc-notes.md).

All correctness-critical paths went through an adversarial multi-agent review pass
before this status was claimed — see `PROGRESS.md`.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # placeholders work out of the box
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:3000
```

Connect a wallet, switch to **Arc Testnet** when prompted, and fund it from the
[Circle faucet](https://faucet.circle.com).

## Known limitations (MVP)

Surfaced by an adversarial multi-agent review pass; the correctness bugs are fixed, these
are the deliberate scope calls:

- **No wallet authentication yet.** The tags API (private categorization metadata) trusts
  the `address` param, so tags are readable/writable per address without a signature
  (IDOR). Proper fix is Sign-In-with-Ethereum; deferred as it's a full auth layer, and
  this is a testnet MVP. The **chain-derived data (income, verify) needs no auth** — it's
  public + recomputed.
- **Verify links are unauthenticated + not globally rate-limited.** Amplification is
  bounded per link (≤500 disclosed txs + short ISR caching on `/verify`); global
  rate-limiting belongs at the deploy edge and is deferred.
- **History indexes the most recent ~6,000 transfers** (memo enrichment: most recent
  ~250). Truncation is surfaced in the UI rather than silently dropped.
